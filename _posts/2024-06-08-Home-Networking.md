## Homelab Networking

This project involves physical networking; having purchased a switch and using an older PC to create a firewall and IPS/IDS I intend to configuring my home network. The majority of the network cannot be configured and
will therefore be ignored with the focus on my segment of the network following the router to my firewall and then outward into the switch and local area network. The goals of this project is to learn about physical networking
and configure subnets and VLANS, ending with configuring opensense as a firewall and IPS/IDS.
