## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

IDS is a passive monitoring solution for detecting possible malicious activities/patterns, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. It is responsible for generating alerts for each suspicious event. 

There are two main types of IDS systems;

    Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - NIDS monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network. The aim is to investigate the traffic on the entire subnet. If a signature is identified, an alert is created.
    Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) - HIDS monitors the traffic flow from a single endpoint device. The aim is to investigate the traffic on a particular device. If a signature is identified, an alert is created.

## Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

IPS is an active protection solution for preventing malicious activities/patterns, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. It is responsible for stopping/preventing/terminating the suspicious event as soon as the detection is performed.

 There are four main types of IPS systems;

    Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) - NIPS monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network. The aim is to protect the traffic on the entire subnet. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.
    Behaviour-based Intrusion Prevention System (Network Behaviour Analysis - NBA) - Behaviour-based systems monitor the traffic flow from various areas of the network. The aim is to protect the traffic on the entire subnet. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.

Network Behaviour Analysis System works similarly to NIPS. The difference between NIPS and Behaviour-based is; that behaviour-based systems require a training period (also known as "baselining") to learn the normal traffic and differentiate the malicious traffic and threats. This model provides more efficient results against new threats.

The system is trained to know the "normal" to detect "abnormal". The training period is crucial to avoid any false positives. In case of any security breach during the training period, the results will be highly problematic. Another critical point is to ensure that the system is well trained to recognise benign activities. 

    Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) - WIPS monitors the traffic flow from a wireless network. The aim is to protect the wireless traffic and stop possible attacks launched from there. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.
    Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) - HIPS actively protects the traffic flow from a single endpoint device. The aim is to investigate the traffic on a particular device. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.

HIPS working mechanism is similar to HIDS. The difference between them is that while HIDS creates alerts for threats, HIPS stops the threats by terminating the connection.

## Summary

IDS can identify threats but require user assistance to stop them.
IPS can identify and block the threats with less user assistance at the detection time.

## Snort

SNORT is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It was developed and still maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team. 

Capabilities of Snort;

    Live traffic analysis
    Attack and probe detection
    Packet logging
    Protocol analysis
    Real-time alerting
    Modules & plugins
    Pre-processors
    Cross-platform support! (Linux & Windows)

Snort has three main use models;

    Sniffer Mode - Read IP packets and prompt them in the console application.
    Packet Logger Mode - Log all IP packets (inbound and outbound) that visit the network.
    NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)  and NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System) Modes - Log/drop the packets that are deemed as malicious according to the user-defined rules.

## Snort Rule Structure

![image](https://github.com/ItWozNotMe/itwoznotme.github.io/assets/74746341/853c4efa-7df5-46d7-87da-04e9bf3bea37)

Each rule should have a type of action, protocol, source and destination IP, source and destination port and an option. Remember, Snort is in passive mode by default. So most of the time, you will use Snort as an IDS. You will need to start "inline mode" to turn on IPS mode. But before you start playing with inline mode, you should be familiar with Snort features and rules.

The Snort rule structure is easy to understand but difficult to produce.

Direction

The direction operator indicates the traffic flow to be filtered by Snort. The left side of the rule shows the source, and the right side shows the destination.

    -> Source to destination flow.
    <> Bidirectional flow

There are three main rule options in Snort;

    General Rule Options - Fundamental rule options for Snort. 
    Payload Rule Options - Rule options that help to investigate the payload data. These options are helpful to detect specific payload patterns.
    Non-Payload Rule Options - Rule options that focus on non-payload data. These options will help create specific patterns and identify network issues.

ï»¿Points to Remember

Main Components of Snort

    Packet Decoder - Packet collector component of Snort. It collects and prepares the packets for pre-processing. 
    Pre-processors - A component that arranges and modifies the packets for the detection engine.
    Detection Engine - The primary component that process, dissect and analyse the packets by applying the rules. 
    Logging and Alerting - Log and alert generation component.
    Outputs and Plugins - Output integration modules (i.e. alerts to syslog/mysql) and additional plugin (rule management detection plugins) support is done with this component. 

There are three types of rules available for snort

    Community Rules - Free ruleset under the GPLv2. Publicly accessible, no need for registration.
    Registered Rules - Free ruleset (requires registration). This ruleset contains subscriber rules with 30 days delay.
    Subscriber Rules (Paid) - Paid ruleset (requires subscription). This ruleset is the main ruleset and is updated twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays).
