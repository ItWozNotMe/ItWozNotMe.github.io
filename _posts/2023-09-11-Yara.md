## What is Yara?

Yara can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained within a file.

Rules are used to label these patterns. For example, Yara rules are frequently written to determine if a file is malicious or not, based upon the features - or patterns - it presents. Strings are a fundamental component of programming languages. Applications use strings to store data such as text.

## Introduction to Yara Rules

The proprietary language that Yara uses for rules is fairly trivial to pick up, but hard to master. This is because your rule is only as effective as your understanding of the patterns you want to search for.

Using a Yara rule is simple. Every yara command requires two arguments to be valid, these are:
1) The rule file we create
2) Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for.

Every rule must have a name and condition.

## Expanding on Yara Rules

Meta
This section of a Yara rule is reserved for descriptive information by the author of the rule. For example, you can use desc, short for description, to summarise what your rule checks for. Anything within this section does not influence the rule itself. Similar to commenting code, it is useful to summarise your rule.


Strings

You can use strings to search for specific text or hexadecimal in files or programs. For example, say we wanted to search a directory for all files containing "Hello World!", we would create a rule such as below:

rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
		$hello_world
}

Essentially, if any file has the string "Hello World!" then the rule will match. However, this is literally saying that it will only match if "Hello World!" is found and will not match if "hello world" or "HELLO WORLD."

## Using Loki

Scenario: You are the security analyst for a mid-size law firm. A co-worker discovered suspicious files on a web server within your organization. These files were discovered while performing updates to the corporate website. The files have been copied to your machine for analysis

In this room, we explored Yara, how to use Yara, and manually created basic Yara rules. We also explored various open-source tools to hit the ground running that utilizes Yara rules to detect evil on endpoints.
