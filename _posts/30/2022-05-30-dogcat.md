This room will allow me to start completing the ‘Starter Series’ on TryHackMe; a series of beginner ctfs to assist with developing my penetration testing skils.

To start the ctf, I opted to use a nmap scan revealing port/22 and port/80, as good practise I viewed the page 
source. After this I started a gobuster scan.

The vulnerability is local file inclusion, and the technique involved, using a filter to endode with base64. (https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2011/02/using-php-filter-for-local-file-inclusion/)

Proof of concept when using index=dog

This can be decoded using the command line

Using the same technique as before, I opted to include 'dog' within the resource and then changed the directory and navigated to index giving me more base64 encoded text. This once again can be decoded using the command line.
